    <h2>Beautiful, deadly and endangered. The tiger is all of these!!!!</h2>

    <p> Just some random facts and information about tigers.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            The tiger is the largest of the four “big cats” (lions, jaguars, leopard and tigers) and is an apex
            predator, meaning it resides at the top of their food chain with no predators of their own.
        </li>

        <li>
            The larger tiger subspecies can reach up to 3.3 metres (11 ft) in total length, weighing up to 300 kilograms
            (660 pounds), with canines up to 4 inches long.
        </li>

        <li>
            Among the big cats, only the tiger and jaguar are strong swimmers; tigers are often found bathing in ponds,
            lakes, and rivers. During the extreme heat of the day, they often cool off in pools. Tigers are excellent
            swimmers, and are able to carry prey through the water.
